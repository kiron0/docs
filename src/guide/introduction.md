# Introduction

Welcome to **NullScript** - JavaScript with Attitude! ðŸŽ­

NullScript is a fun parody programming language that adds personality to your JavaScript development. It transpiles directly to clean, readable JavaScript while giving you creative keyword alternatives that make coding more enjoyable.

## What is NullScript?

NullScript is:

- **A transpiler** that converts `.ns` files to JavaScript
- **100% JavaScript compatible** - same runtime behavior
- **Zero overhead** - no runtime dependencies or performance cost
- **Fun to use** - creative keywords that spark joy in programming

## Philosophy

We believe programming should be both productive and enjoyable. NullScript maintains all the power and compatibility of JavaScript while adding a layer of personality that makes development more fun.

### Key Principles

1. **JavaScript First** - Everything compiles to clean, standard JavaScript
2. **Zero Runtime Cost** - No additional dependencies or performance overhead
3. **Full Compatibility** - Works with all JavaScript tools, libraries, and environments
4. **Developer Joy** - Programming should spark creativity and fun

## How It Works

NullScript uses a simple transpilation process:

1. **Write** your code in `.ns` files using NullScript syntax
2. **Compile** using the `nsc` CLI tool
3. **Run** the generated JavaScript in any environment

```
hello.ns â†’ Transpiler â†’ hello.js â†’ Any JS Runtime
```

The output is always clean, readable JavaScript that you could have written by hand.

## What's Different?

Instead of writing:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}
```

You write:

```javascript
run greet(name) {
  speak.say(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}
```

Both compile to the same JavaScript output, but NullScript adds personality to your development experience.
